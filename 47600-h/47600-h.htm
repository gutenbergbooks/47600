  <p>To gratify a laudable curiosity, and lead the mind to the exercise of one of its noblest
  faculties, was the motive that first encouraged me to publish a work of this kind. How far it has
  answered these ends, what pleasure it has produced, of what benefit or advantage it has been to
  mankind, by inducing them to contemplate the admirable works of Providence, and trace its wisdom
  and goodness through the medium of this branch of the history of nature, are circumstances, the
  confined sphere of life in which I have hitherto moved, has not given me those opportunities of
  knowing that I could wish. But the kind reception the first volume of this work has met with,
  seems to justify the opinion that it has not been written in vain.</p>

  <p>In the Preface to my former volume, I told my readers, that my design of giving an addition to
  that work, would entirely depend on the reception the public should be pleased to give it. I was
  willing to have some proof of the public approbation, before I ventured rashly to engage further
  in so considerable an expense as the engraving and colouring the plates, &amp;c. which was too
  great for me to incur without a prospect of a reimbursement.</p>

  <p>It is now with the utmost pleasure I can declare, that I have the greatest reason to be
  satisfied on that head; the world has generously encouraged my first attempt, and it is to that
  cause the present volume owes its appearance. The quick sale of a great number of copies, on the
  first publication, was a proof of the great progress natural history had made; and gave me the
  utmost hopes a continuation might be equally as acceptable, if conducted on the same plan, and
  rendered as agreeable by the exertion of the artist's abilities. I have now the satisfaction of
  offering a volume to the public not inferior to the first.</p>

  <p>It is a pleasing reflection to consider the great strides natural history is making in this
  kingdom, as well as in other parts of the world; and the many publications on the various subjects
  of nature, that have made their appearance within these last three or four years, is a
  circumstance that must give every man of a liberal mind the greatest satisfaction. We <span
  class="pagenum" id="pageiv">{iv}</span>see persons, skilled in natural history, receiving
  encouragements and reward from men of rank and property, according to their respective abilities.
  Some are encouraged to pursue their studies in foreign parts, and investigate the secrets of
  nature among the trees and plants; others are employed in discovering countries, and searching the
  shores of coasts, hitherto unknown, for subjects that will afford either profit or speculative
  pleasure; while the artist at home is not neglected and abandoned, but meets the reward his merit
  entitles him to.</p>

  <p>Natural history has, certainly, less reason to court the favour of mankind than many other
  branches of knowlege; as the pursuit of it, either as a science or amusement, is so replete with
  pleasure, that it is hardly possible to refuse it our approbation and encouragement, so soon as we
  give ourselves the least time to enquire into its merits; and we are often stimulated to pursue it
  from the appearance of that inexhaustible store of entertainment it is sure to afford. It is
  therefore less to be wondered at that publications on these subjects are more numerous than
  formerly; as the desire of communicating knowledge and happiness is irresistible, and men, for
  their own sakes, will be induced to follow the tracks, where the enjoyment of unallayed pleasure
  lies within their grasp.</p>

  <p>I shall not dwell any longer on this part of the subject, but inform the reader, that the same
  plan, of giving <i>just</i> and accurate figures, that was followed in the first volume, is
  continued in this. The utmost care and nicety has been observed, both in the outlines and
  engraving. Nothing is strained or carried beyond the bounds nature has set; and whoever will
  compare the engravings with the originals, I flatter myself will allow, that nothing is borrowed
  from fancy, or any colour given to an insect that does not really exist in the subject intended to
  be represented.</p>

  <p>It is true, the want of those remarks and observations on their natural history, similar to
  those inserted in my first volume, is a circumstance I have great reason to lament. I mentioned my
  opinion of the cause in my former address, in which I have since been confirmed by repeated
  proofs; and notwithstanding the great labour and trouble I have been at, not only in procuring the
  subjects of the present volume, but in endeavouring also to get the natural history of some of the
  most extraordinary of them, I have not been able to obtain one single piece of information proper
  to be laid before the public.</p>

  <p>It is to little or no purpose to make further enquiry into the reasons of this want of
  curiosity, among all ranks of people, situated in distant climates, more than I have already done.
  I find it is so; and whether it proceeds from an ill-judged pride, in thinking such minute animals
  below their notice, or whether it arises from that languor of mind, as well as of body, that
  generally prevails in warm climates, is a matter of no consequence to mankind: the world is not
  benefited by their situations, and we must be content to remain in our present ignorance, till
  Providence shall think proper to give us a second Swammerdam, or Reaumur, &amp;c. and place him in
  a distant part of the globe, for the advantage of the human race.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagev">{v}</span></div>

  <p>It is necessary to mention, that both the descriptions, and engravings, were finished about the
  beginning of the year 1771, and as some of the insects are mentioned as non-descripts, that since
  that time have appeared in other works, I hope I shall not be considered as guilty of an
  imposition on that account.</p>

  <p>The present age has made great improvements in <i>entomology</i>, as well as other parts of
  natural history. The many publications that have appeared on that subject within these two years,
  are proofs how well works of this kind are received; and as all iconographers aim at giving
  representations of unfigured subjects, it is no wonder if some contained in this volume should be
  presented to the world by those who happened to have got the start of me. The plates were actually
  engraved, and great part of the prints coloured, before I discovered that any of the subjects had
  been figured by other authors; and to have suppressed them on account of the very few that are
  found in other works, would have incurred an expense greater than the nature of the case would
  allow.</p>

  <p>The objection made of the want of <i>names</i> to the insects contained in my first volume, the
  reader will here find removed; and <i>trivial</i> as well as <i>generical</i> ones, given to every
  insect in the whole work: and likewise a few errors of the press corrected, that have almost
  imperceptibly got in. I was, indeed, truly sensible of the defect and incompleteness of that
  volume, occasioned by the above circumstance, and would gladly have named every insect then
  delineated; but the different opinions subsisting at that time among entomologists, some
  preferring one author and some another, made me exceeding cautious of entering on that business:
  and I rather chose to defer it to the present opportunity, than give occasion for any reflections
  against me, for my attachment to an author, whose method I should certainly have pursued, and
  whose works have deservedly entitled him to the appellation of <i>father</i> of natural history. I
  mean the excellent Linneus, whose system seems now to be generally approved and followed; and I
  must here mention, the opportunity that the present work affords of giving an explanation of the
  terms, &amp;c. in his work, I should certainly have availed myself of, for the benefit of the
  young beginner; but as my friend, Mr. Curtis, has published a good translation of the "Fundamenta
  Entomologiæ" of that author, wherein the young student, as well as the adept, who are not versed
  in the Latin tongue, may receive great improvement; I must refer them to that work for the
  properly understanding the plan and design of that great author.</p>

  <p>The reader will observe, that in giving <i>trivial</i> names I have strictly followed the
  method of Linneus. The Butterflies entitled to be ranked among the Equites, are named after some
  great personage found among the Greeks and Trojans; as in Plate <a href="#plate3">iii</a>. Fig. 1.
  where I have named the insect Antenor, from a Trojan prince; and Plate <a href="#plate9">ix</a>.
  Fig. 1, 2. Menestheus from a Grecian one; one belonging to the Eq. Trojanes, the other to Eq.
  Achivi. I have likewise followed his rule in naming the insects belonging to other classes; and
  given such as I concluded to be the most easily retained in the memory. To this end also I have
  used the Latin language in preference to the English, for the great liberty it allows <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagevi">{vi}</span>of compounding and decompounding words and names; a
  circumstance of the greatest consequence in a business of this sort.</p>

  <p class="sp3">I should think myself totally unpardonable, if I finished this address without
  acknowledging the obligation I am under to several friends, whose assistance in this work claim
  the utmost return of gratitude; among these, in a most particular manner I must mention Dr.
  Fothergill, whose readiness to encourage and promote every part of natural history, must endear
  him to every man who wishes well to so useful and beneficial a branch of knowledge; and it is to
  the kindness of that gentleman the reader will perceive I am indebted for a great number of
  figures that form a considerable part of this work; many of which are so very rare, as not to be
  met with in any other cabinet.</p>

    <p><i>Upper Side.</i> Head, thorax, and abdomen dusky brown. Anterior wings fine mellow dark
    brown or snuff colour towards the tips; but near the body, glowing with a fine dark glossy
    purple. Near the tip of each wing are two small white specks, one scarcely visible; on the lower
    part of each wing is a rather large oval spot, of the same snuff colour with that near the tips.
    Posterior edges circularly dilated, and gradually widening from the shoulders to the external
    edges. Posterior wings dark brown, but glowing all over in some directions with a dark glossy
    blueish purple. Near the abdominal corners are two black eyes on each wing, surrounded by
    beautiful dazzling blue.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> Breast and sides yellowish sandy-coloured. Anterior wings
    divided into three parts by two lines or bars; one being brown and narrow, the other white and
    rather broad. The first division, next the body, is of a russet or light hair colour, tinctured
    with pearl, having a short black streak near the middle; the next, or middle division, is light
    brown; the third is dark clay-coloured. A considerable number of long hairs arising from a
    single point or stalk, spreading like the leaves of a fan, and occupying the space corresponding
    with the oval spot mentioned before; those on the outside bending downwards, and curling. (See
    Fig. 3. This circumstance is peculiar to one sex only.) Posterior wings next the body russet,
    with a single black spot near the middle of each. Abdominal groove russet. <span class="pagenum"
    id="page2">{2}</span>Middle of the wing with a rather broad bar of a fine deep chocolate colour,
    beginning at the anterior edge and ending at the abdominal groove; the upper side of the bar
    next the body being russet. Lower part of the wing, next the external edge, of a colour between
    russet and chocolate, with three small white spots near the upper corner. The two black eyes are
    distinct on this side, with narrow blue irides. The wings are a little dentated.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">Drury's figure represents an individual in which the posterior wings have no
  appearance of the short tail, which the species ordinarily exhibits. It may, perhaps, originate in
  the figure being taken from a mutilated specimen. The Papilio Morna of Fabricius, appears nearly
  allied to this insect.</p>

    markings. Posterior wings of the same greyish brown. Cilia white. A little above the abdominal
    corners are four white spots, placed close together; the two inner ones being smallest. Each of
    these wings is furnished with three tails, the upper parts of which are black, the other parts
    white; the middle one being almost as long as the wing, the other two are about half that
    length.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> Palpi, head, and breast white. Legs white and brown. Wings
    fine silvery white. A small, narrow, orange-coloured line begins at the middle of the anterior
    edge of the fore wings: which, crossing them and the hind ones, runs almost to the abdominal
    corner, where it suddenly turns back and ends at the abdominal groove. Near this part are two
    small black spots, one placed between the two outer tails, and the other on the abdominal
    edge.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Fabricius gives the sexes of this insect as distinct species, under the names cited
  above, stating India to be the habitat of Hesiodus (or the male). Palisot de Bauvois has, however,
  satisfactorily cleared up the error, by figuring both sexes from Africa. The male has the disc of
  the wings, on the upper side, of a rich blue colour.</p>

  <p>Drury states that he was ignorant from what part of the world his specimen (which was given to
  him by Mr. Leman) came from. No other individual of this species is recorded to exist in the
  modern collections, and it is from the figure and description of Drury that all subsequent writers
  have derived their knowledge of this splendid and unique insect.</p>

  <p>Donovan, however, figured this butterfly, or rather copied Drury's figure in his beautiful work
  upon the Insects of India, observing merely that it might be "mentioned with much propriety
  amongst the rarest of the Papilio tribe found in India," without giving any account of the source
  from whence his figure and information had been obtained.</p>

  <p>At the sale of Mr. Drury's collection, this butterfly composed lot 4 of the first day's sale,
  May 23, 1805, and was purchased by Mr. Latham at the price of £2. 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The Rev. F. W. Hope, however, possesses a specimen, which he has informed me, that
  he obtained in a small collection of rare insects from tropical Africa, collected by the late Mr.
  Ritchie.</p>

    <p><i>Upper Side.</i> Head, thorax, and abdomen velvety black. Wings fine deep black; with two
    narrow bars of a beautiful Saxon or blueish green colour, which begin about the middle of the
    anterior edges of the anterior wings, and crossing both them and the posterior, meet at the
    abdominal edges near the <span class="pagenum" id="page7">{7}</span>abdominal corners, running
    parallel with the external edges. Anterior wings with two small blue spots placed on each near
    the tips, and another, larger, divided into three by the nerves, near the middle of the anterior
    edge; being placed at the top and even with the bar, but divided from it by a small separation
    of black. The edges of these wings are entire. Posterior wings with six blue spots on each,
    placed along the external edges; the four lower ones being in pairs, and another small one at
    the abdominal corners; margins deeply angulated.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Under Side.</i> Breast and sides dark brown, spotted with white. Abdomen
    brown. Wings dark brown hair-coloured, immaculate, except the posterior ones, which have a row
    of eleven cream-coloured spots running along the external edges.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The female differs from the male in being somewhat larger in size, with the spots on the upper
  side of a brighter green colour, and with the marginal row of spots on the under side of the
  posterior wings of a pearly greyish hue, and with a tinge of this colour upon the disk of the
  wings. Cramer has figured the male as the female, and vice versa. Mr. Smeathman informed Mr. Drury
  that this insect feeds upon the orange and lime trees, about which the butterfly is always seen
  flying, considering it as remarkable that most of the insects which feed upon the orange or citron
  tribes, have some tinge of green upon them; in like manner the beautiful green snake, so common
  about Sierra Leone, is always to be found about these kind of trees. These circumstances led our
  author into a series of observations which, though upwards of half a century old, may still be
  read not only with pleasure, but with the hope of beneficial results.</p>

  <p>"The particular qualities, dispositions, and uses of by far the greater part of insects, as
  well as of plants, are at present totally unknown to us, nor are the methods by which we are to
  acquire that knowledge at present ascertained.</p>

  <p>"Their colours have hitherto been of no further use to us than merely to discriminate one genus
  or species from another; and yet it is possible that, by a combination of observations even on the
  colours of insects, we may form some ideas of their natures and properties.</p>

  <p>"The observation of Mr. Smeathman, if well founded, supposing it did not lead to a discovery of
  the nature and properties of an insect itself, might at least indicate those of the plant on which
  it feeds. The various species of the <i>Danai Candidi</i>, among which are included the different
  white butterflies of Europe, feed chiefly on such plants as are reckoned not only nourishing, but
  salutary to the human body, such as the various species of cabbages, coleworts, turnips, &amp;c.
  Every foreign country produces butterflies of that family; some of them so very like those of
  Europe, that it is a fair inference they feed on plants of a similar property. This is
  countenanced by many corroborating circumstances. The <i>Papilio Iris</i>, and the various
  <i>Fritillary</i> butterflies fly exceedingly swift; and it appears from Mr. Smeathman's
  observations, that foreign butterflies that bear a resemblance to them, also fly exceedingly
  swift. The green and golden <i>Scarabei</i> of this country are found to delight in flowers; those
  of the hot climates are also found on flowers; while the black, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page8">{8}</span>purple, and darker coloured <i>Scarabei</i>, are generally found frequenting
  the excrements of animals, and are, in every quarter of the globe, called Tumble dung-beetles,
  from their making balls of those substances, and rolling them to their holes. The locust tribes
  feed here chiefly on grasses and roots; so it appears they do in the torrid zone. Those of the
  torrid zone are found to be wholesome food. The inference is plain, that those of this climate, in
  case of necessity, or perhaps even as an article of luxury, might be found the same.</p>

  <p>"The caterpillars of certain beetles, from his account, are the greatest delicacies of the hot
  regions. They might, in some degree, be found to be so here. The palm-worm of the West Indies,
  which is sought at a monstrous expense, is the caterpillar or maggot of a beetle, of the same
  genus with that small beetle, which is produced from the maggot or caterpillar in a hazel-nut or
  filberd. This is often eaten here, and esteemed by those who do so as more delicate than the nut
  itself.</p>

  <p>"The Cantharides is a <i>green</i> beetle. A green beetle of our own, <i>Cerambyx
  Moschatus</i>, is found capable of raising blisters; and other <i>green</i> beetles may probably
  have the same effect.</p>

  <p>"The butterflies that are found in the cultivated spots of Africa, have in shape and appearance
  a strong resemblance to many of ours, particularly the white ones. These seldom visit the thick
  woods; but, when seen in any number, are certain indications of neighbouring plantations. This
  observation might save the lives of bewildered travellers: as in some instances it might be
  dangerous to enter into a very large wood, or a thick part of it; in others again, immediate
  safety might be the consequence of leaving a forest, by following the indications of an open or
  cultivated spot. The analogy between the colours, the dispositions, and the qualities of insects,
  may yet be greater, and between insects, and the plants on which they feed, still more useful; for
  if an insect is found in one part of the world to feed on a plant useful in food, medicine, or
  manufactures, an insect of a similar appearance, in another part of the world, will in all
  probability be found to feed on a plant of similar virtues. We do not know but insects may affect,
  when perfect, to frequent different soils; or to visit the recesses, where valuable drugs remain
  hid from human search, and useless to mankind.</p>

  <p>"As, however, observation and experience have demonstrated, through length of time, that useful
  hints may be drawn from very trivial properties in the smallest insects, it seems that none are
  unworthy of being noted. Future travellers may draw useful inferences from those now given, and
  may add to the number, for the benefit of those who follow after them. There can be no doubt that
  every species of insect has its use in the creation, and probably there are few from which mankind
  might not derive some advantage, if their nature and properties were ascertained. We know of a few
  direct methods, and must therefore in general wait with patience, till a variety of observations,
  such as Mr. Smeathman has given us, by being frequently compared, strike out new lights upon this
  part of <span class="pagenum" id="page9">{9}</span>science, and elucidate matters at this time
  buried in obscurity. The uses of many insects in the creation are obvious at the first sight:
  such, for instance, are those which feed on putrid animal or vegetable substances; while others
  promote the general good by such remote means, that we cannot immediately see to what end their
  operations verge. We are not therefore, however, to suppose them mere expletives in the great
  system of beings; neither are we rashly to attribute an importance to them which they do not
  deserve, or ridiculously affect to admire circumstances in them of little moment, and praise the
  Creator for dispositions of a secondary nature.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"When I recommend observations to be made on the most trivial circumstances, it
  will readily be conceived I do not wish to derogate from experiment, from which alone solid hopes
  are to be formed, and those which have been hitherto made give great encouragement. Mr. Reaumur
  has found that the moth, which feeds on clothes, refines the colour with which they are dyed in a
  wonderful manner; for the excrement of the animal is the colour of the cloth on which it is fed;
  and therefore, for miniature paintings, infinitely surpasses all others. How far this kind of
  experiment can be refined on, must be left to the curiosity and diligence of travellers and
  experimental philosophers, who may perhaps, in some part of the world, realize and improve this
  reasoning upon a large and useful scale."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The curious structure of the antennæ of this insect (which is, doubtless, peculiar

  larger size, pearly wings, and different quarters of the globe in which these two species are
  found, make it doubtful whether the two insects belong strictly to the same subgenus. It is
  evidently nearly allied to the British genus Margaritia. Mr. Smeathman informed Drury that this is
  one of the Phalænæ which fly during the day. A little noise or rustling disturbs it, when it takes
  rapid flights of twenty or thirty yards, hiding itself with great ingenuity, which makes it
  difficult to catch.</p>

  <p class="sp3">From Dr. Roxburgh's interesting memoir upon the silk-producing moths of the East
  Indies,<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> it appears that this species is named the
  Arundi or Arrindy silk-worm, the caterpillars feeding upon the Arrindi, Ricinus, or Palma Christi.
  It is capable of being reared in the same way as the common silk-worm, the eggs are hatched in
  about ten or fifteen days; in about a month the caterpillars attain their full size, during which
  period they cast their skins three or four times. The caterpillar is from two and a half to three
  inches in length, each segment being furnished with several small soft conical tubercles, the
  prevailing colour being pale green. In this state they are very voracious, devouring daily many
  times their own weight of food. The cocoons are white or yellowish, of a very soft and delicate
  texture; in general about two or three inches in length, and three in circumference, and pointed
  at both ends. In this cocoon the chrysalis remains from ten to twenty days, the moth appearing at
  one end, the period of its final state not extending beyond from four to eight days. The moths are
  quiet, seldom attempting to fly from the apartment in which they are reared. The silk is so
  exceedingly delicate and flossy, that it is impracticable to wind it off; it is, therefore, spun
  like cotton, and the thread thus manufactured is woven into a coarse kind of white cloth, of a
  loose texture, but of surprising durability, the life of one person seldom being sufficient to
  wear out a garment made from it, the same piece descending from mother to daughter. It is used not
  only for clothing, but also for packing light clothes, &amp;c. Some manufacturers in England to
  whom it was shewn seemed to think that it could be made here into shawls equal to any received
  from India.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Linnæan specific name of the type of the present genus was Papilio Idea, a name
  admirably expressive of the delicate transparent structure of these butterflies. As several
  closely-allied species were discovered in addition to the original type, all partaking of the same
  appearance, Fabricius transposed the original specific name into that of the genus; a new specific
  name, Agelia, being given to the original species, which is beautifully figured by Donovan, in his
  Insects of India, Pl. 24, and is by him considered identical with the insect figured by Drury. I
  have adopted the opinion of the authors of the Encyclopédie Méthodique, who consider the two
  insects as distinct.</p>

  Northwestern territory, during the advance of Major Long's expedition toward Lake Winnepec. He
  also found it at that lake as well as at the Lake of the Woods, and in other parts of Upper
  Canada. He procured specimens likewise from Arkansaw, in the expedition to the Rocky Mountains,
  and received it from Cambridge (Massachusetts).</p>

  <p class="sp3">Drury correctly considered this species as distinct from the Linnæan Hyparete, and
  accordingly named it Eucharis. Fabricius, notwithstanding, united the two species, and applied the
  name Eucharis to another Indian species (Anthocaris Eucharis of Boisduval, but which it would be
  more correct to name Aurora after Cramer). Godart, in order to obviate the confusion arising from
  two distinct species having the same specific name, altered the oldest name (Eucharis, Drury),
  instead of the incorrectly imposed name of Fabricius. I have therefore reverted to the name
  proposed by Drury, the other species being now removed to the genus Anthocaris.</p>

  <p>The transformations to which Lepidopterous insects are subject are amongst the most remarkable
  phenomena of insect life. In the different states to which each is liable, a series of changes is
  exhibited which has been compared, by an admired writer, to what might be supposed to be undergone
  by an animal which for the first five years of its life, exhibited the form of a serpent, which
  then penetrated into the earth, spun for itself a silken coffin, contracting itself into a
  limbless form resembling, more than any thing else, an Egyptian mummy; and which, lastly, after
  remaining in this state for a length of time, burst into the air a winged bird. Of these states,
  it may well be conceived, that the second requires, from its inactivity and helplessness, a secure
  retreat, where, removed and secure from the attack of its enemies, it can rest its appointed
  period during which the organs of flight acquire their full development. We accordingly find that
  the varied manner in which the caterpillars of the different species prepare their retreats,
  affords one of the most interesting branches of investigation in the natural history of the
  Lepidoptera. And in this respect, the species now under consideration certainly exhibits one of
  the most interesting man&#x0153;uvres hitherto recorded amongst the insect tribes, and which is
  described by Mr. Peale in his beautiful "Lepidoptera Americana."<a id="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This moth is very abundant in the vicinity of Philadelphia, at
  least, judging from the number of cocoons seen hanging from the branches of the Sassafras (Laurus
  Sassafras), and Spice-wood (L. Benzoin); and which, by an ordinary observer, would be readily
  mistaken for withered leaves which had withstood the blasts of winter. After the caterpillar has
  attained its full size, and lost the voracious <span class="pagenum"
  id="page22">{22}</span>appetite which had hitherto been its predominant character, it begins its
  preparation for the great transformation it has to undergo, by selecting a perfect leaf, the upper
  surface of which it covers with a fine light yellowish brown silk, extending this coating with
  great skill and foresight, <i>over the footstalk of the leaf</i>, and attaching it firmly to the
  branch, so as to secure the leaf from being separated by any accident. This preliminary operation
  having been accomplished, the caterpillar next draws the edges of the leaf together, thus forming
  a perfect external covering or mantle, in which it spins a fine strong and durable cocoon of fine
  silk. In this habitation the little architect passes the winter secure from birds and other
  enemies. As soon as the cocoon has been completed, the caterpillar sheds its skin, and is
  transformed into a chrysalis. At first the leaf enveloping the cocoon remains green, but soon
  changes to a red or brown, when it becomes brittle, and is gradually carried away by the winds and
  storms of winter, until, finally, nothing remains except the cocoon itself, which is firmly
  suspended by the silk which once covered the footstalk of the leaf.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Mr. Abbot states that the caterpillar also feeds upon the Snowdrop-tree (Halesia
  tetraptera, Linn.) Poplar, Bay, &amp;c. Some individuals spin up in May, and the moth appears in
  June; others, as above described, pass the winter in the chrysalis state.</p>

  <p>It is questionable whether this figure represents the Phalæna senatoria or pellucida of Abbot
  and Smith, by whom the transformations of both species have been illustrated; Smith citing Drury's
  figure with doubt, as belonging to pellucida. I have much pleasure in adopting the present
  well-marked genus proposed by Dr. Thaddeus W. Harris, one of the most distinguished American
  entomologists, in the appendix to the work above referred to; and respecting which I am indebted
  to that gentleman for the following communications:&mdash;"The male of Dryocampa senatoria, of
  Abbot and Smith, has the basal half of the antennæ pectinated on both sides, and the apex simple,
  as in Bombyx (Cerocampa, Kirby; Ceratocampa, Harris's Cat.) regalis and imperialis; and as they
  are described to be in the genus Zeuzera. The larvæ are naked, striped, rigid, with acute
  tubercles, and two thread-like horns on the second segment. They devour the leaves of forest
  trees, particularly oaks, and enter the earth to become pupæ. The edges of the segments of the
  pupæ are denticulated. On account of these peculiar characters, I have ventured to assign to this
  a new generical name; under which will be included also Bombyces pellucida, and Stigma, Fabr.,
  figured in Abbot and Smith's Lepidopterous insects of Georgia; together with B. rubicunda, F. all
  of which are now found to inhabit Massachusets."</p>

  <p class="sp3">In addition to the characters mentioned by Dr. Harris, the peculiar form of the
  posterior wings of the males of these moths may also be noticed, and which are of a triangular
  form, somewhat like those of Erycina menetas (see vol. 3. pl. <a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47601/47601-h/47601-h.htm#plate8">8</a>. fig. 3.), but
  extending to the extremity of the abdomen. This genus is not far removed, in its natural
  affinities, from that of Ceratocampa, (see vol. 1. pl. <a
  href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47599/47599-h/47599-h.htm#plate9">9</a>.)</p>

  <p class="sp3">According to Mr. Smeathman this species is easily disturbed during the day. It
  flies exceedingly rapid, and has a method of striking a leaf or bough at two or three feet
  distance from the place where it really settles. Whether this be done to break the violence of its
  motion, and enable it to settle without injury to its body; or for the purpose of deceiving its
  pursuers, is not easily ascertained; it has, however, the latter, and probably both effects; most
  of the locusts do this, for they certainly strike some branch with a good deal of violence just
  before they alight, the motion of which deceives the eyes and baffles the pursuer.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The larva of this insect is long, smooth, and shining, of a black colour, with
  eight longitudinal continuous yellow lines, with the base of the legs and a spot on the neck red.
  When alarmed it throws up its head and tail into the air. From the structure of the larva it is
  therefore nearly allied to Ptilophora and Petasia, Steph., and not to the buff tip-moth (Pygæra
  bucephala). Its food, according to Abbot, consists of the Andromeda mariana, vulgarly called the
  male hackleberry, which grows round ponds and on the margins of running streams; it eats also
  several species of walnut and oak. One went into the ground on the 31st of July, and the moth came
  out the 23rd of August; another went in the 8th of June, and came forth the 3rd of July. They
  likewise sometimes go into the ground in autumn, and come out in the spring. The whole brood of
  caterpillars feed together in society. Abbot also states, that when they eat walnut leaves they
  are always black, with white hairs;<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> when their food
  is the oak, they are more yellow.</p>

  <p>There are several African species closely allied to the present insect, which was regarded by
  Drury as the Medon of Linnæus. I have followed the Encyclopédie Méthodique in rejecting this
  reference; although it will be seen that the Linnæan description of that insect, "alis supra
  nigris primoribus fascia lutea apiceque albo; posticis disco c&#x0153;rulescentibus," does not
  disagree with the character of this insect.</p>

  <p class="sp3">According to Mr. Smeathman this species was taken at some distance inland upon the
  continent of Africa; adding, "there are several Papiliones nearly of this colour, that is to say,
  with the upper sides of the wings having a changeable purple, and the under sides being inclinable
  to green, sometimes with marks of the most beautiful crimson. The differences between them arise
  so gradually, that he thinks them varieties of the same species, some, apparently very different,
  being found coupled together. They are all found congregating in the paths, and in the thick shade
  of a forest, ten or a dozen in a circle round a little puddle or moist spot, and seem to like the
  most gloomy places."</p>

    light grey; extending almost to the row of white spots, which are seen on this side as well as
    on the upper. The remaining parts are dusky olive, with two rows of faint dark red spots running
    along the external edges. A range of small black spots runs parallel with the external edges of
    all the wings. All the wings are dentated.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There is a diversity of opinion amongst the German and English Lepidopterists,
  relative to the names of this species and the English White Admiral, to which latter Haworth,
  Stephens, &amp;c. give the name of Camilla, but which Illiger, Hubner, &amp;c. term Sibilla. I
  have adopted the former nomenclature, although it will be seen that the figure of Drury, which is
  the Sibilla of the English nomenclature, exhibits a red spot at the anal angle, which Curtis
  considers as the most satisfactory mark of distinction between the two species. (Brit. Ent. p.
  124.)</p>

  </div>

  <p>The splendid insect, from which these figures were taken, has been considered by most
  Lepidopterists to have been in a mutilated and mended state; having the head, concealed palpi, and
  clavate antennæ of a true Papilio, and the posterior wings nearly truncated at the lower part.
  These authors have supposed that the insect was a specimen of the Papilio Rhipheus of Cramer (pl.
  385. fig. A. B. Leilus orientalis, Swainson Zool. Illustr. N. Ser. pl. 130.), in which the head
  and antennæ are similar to those of Nyctalemon Orontes, figured in the first volume of this work,
  and the posterior wings are terminated by three tails. Mr. Swainson has however adopted a
  different opinion, figuring Drury's insect under the name of Rhipheus Dasycephalus, and Cramer's
  under that of Leilus Orientalis; considering that this view of the subject "will clear up one of
  the most intricate and perplexing questions that has hitherto impeded the natural arrangement of
  the Linnæan Papiliones and even the entire Lepidoptera." Drury's insect exhibiting the nervures of
  Urania, and the head, &amp;c. of Papilio, is thus considered as establishing as close an affinity
  as can possibly be imagined between Papilio and Leilus (i. e. the Rhipheus of Cramer). It is true
  that there are many Lepidopterous insects which, on a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page43">{43}</span>casual glance, appear identical, but which belong to distinct groups,
  especially distinguished by the neuration of their wings, but when we consider the almost perfect
  identity, in the very peculiar markings and colours, of these two supposed distinct insects, the
  identity in the nerves of their wings;<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the slight
  scruple which the old collectors had in patching up their insects, and the truncation of the hind
  wings in Drury's figure, which may be exactly imitated by placing a slip of paper over the tails
  of perfect tailed specimens of Rhipheus, I think we are authorised in rejecting, without
  hesitation, the views of Mr. Swainson.</p>

  <p class="sp3">That this group of insects is one of the most interesting amongst the Lepidoptera,
  and at the same time exceedingly difficult, with respect to its natural relations, cannot be
  denied. Modern authors, Mr. Swainson observes, have been unfortunate in their location of this
  group, of course alluding to its being placed by Latreille in the family Hesperiidæ. Mr. Swainson,
  however, is not less unfortunate in his introduction of it into the family Papilionidæ, with which
  the structure of the fore legs is said peculiarly to rank it. This character, nevertheless,
  together with its day-flying habits and brilliant colours, are the only points in which an
  affinity can be traced between the Papilionidæ and Uraniidæ. But the structure of the hind legs
  (having spurs in the middle, as well as at the tips of the tibiæ), and of the nerves of the wings,
  antennæ, and palpi, all exhibit a very slight degree of relationship with Papilio. Mr. Swainson
  has, indeed, endeavoured to make the affinity more evident by introducing Papilio Curius, Fabr. as
  a subgenus (Leptocircus) in the genus Leilus (or Urania), but the relationship between these is of
  the slightest and most unsatisfactory kind. Mr. Newman has suggested another view of the
  affinities of this group. In his sketch of the circular distribution of the Lepidoptera,<a
  id="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> he has introduced into the Butterfly circle, the genera
  Coronis and Urania, the last forming the connecting link with the Geometridæ, by Leach's genus
  Ourapteryx, or the Swallow-tail Moth. The whole structure of the latter insect indicates, however,
  most clearly that the relation is but an analogical one. Had, indeed, the observations of M.
  Sganzin,<a id="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> relative to the transformations of Urania
  Rhipheus been confirmed, this would certainly have been its more appropriate locality, its
  caterpillar being said by him to be a semi-looper, and its chrysalis to be naked, suspended by the
  tail, and girt round the centre. But the elaborate memoir of Mr. MacLeay,<a id="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> upon the habits and changes of Urania Fernandinæ, prove most
  clearly that the larva closely resembles that of Agarista;<a id="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> and that the pupa, as in that genus, is inclosed in a cocoon. Now
  this latter character exists in some species of Hesperia. In these, however, the chrysalis is
  still attached by its tail. Mr. MacLeay does not mention whether such is the case in Urania; but
  since his return from Cuba he has had the kindness to shew me the cocoon, and to inform me that
  the chrysalis is loose. This character, <span class="pagenum" id="page44">{44}</span>therefore,
  with the entire structure of the imago, removes it from the Diurnal Lepidoptera, and associates it
  most satisfactorily with the Hesperi-sphinges of Latreille, especially Agarista and Coronis, which
  last is very near Urania Lunus. Thus the situation proposed for these insects by Latreille,
  between Hesperia and Agarista, &amp;c. is found to be most fortunate; Mr. Swainson himself
  admitting a relationship with the Hesperiidæ, by calling them the "Hesperian" type of the
  Papilionidæ. They also appear to have some relation with Erebus. The original specimen here
  figured is stated by Mr. Drury to have been in the possession of Captain May, of Hammersmith, when
  the drawing was made. It is now in all probability destroyed, and cannot be traced.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar of this very conspicuous moth feeds upon the red oak (Quercus rubra, Linn.),
  and other species of the same genus. The caterpillars represented by Abbot are considerably
  different in colour; one being dark-coloured, but covered over with minute yellow spots; and the
  other yellow, with a slender, dorsal, and two broader lateral black lines. The head is red, and
  each segment is furnished with a transverse series of tubercles, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page46">{46}</span>emitting spinose setæ. It is, I presume, by the assistance of these setæ
  that "the caterpillar stings very sharply," as stated by Abbot. When small the whole brood lives
  together, but they disperse as they grow larger. One of these larvæ, in Virginia, went into the
  ground on the 1st of July, and the moth came out on the 20th of October; whilst in Georgia another
  buried itself on the 14th of June, and the fly did not appear until the 8th of December; after
  which other individuals kept coming out from time to time until the 16th of February. The male
  appears by day, and flies very swiftly, mounting and descending. The moth is called in America the
  Buck-fly, from an erroneous idea that its caterpillars are bred in the heads of the buck, which
  blow them out of their nostrils. This opinion originates from the fly coming out in the rutting
  season whilst the bucks are pursuing the does; the hunters therefore take notice of the insect in
  order to know the proper season for their sport, which is later in Georgia than in Virginia, as is
  also the appearance of the moth. They are much more plentiful in the last-mentioned country.

  <p>Fabricius cites the present figure amongst his synonyms of the common English Eyed-hawk moth
  (Smerinthus ocellatus), notwithstanding its very different habitat. It is evident, however, from
  the diversity in the outline of the wings of this insect and other English species, and from the
  circumstance of several species very closely allied to this being found in America (two of which
  are figured by Abbot and Smith in "the Insects of Georgia," pl. 25. and 26.), that Fabricius
  overlooked the minute characters which distinguish these species, and confounded them under the
  name of Ocellatus. Drury's insect very nearly approaches Sphinx Myops of Smith, but differs in the
  markings, especially of the posterior edge of the wings, and the colour of the posterior pair.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Sir J. E. Smith notices the very slight difference which exists between the
  caterpillars of nearly allied species of Sphingidæ, compared with the diversity in the larvæ of
  the genus Papilio of Linnæus.</p>

  winter-berry, or gall-berry (Prinos glaber, Linn.), whence Sir J. E. Smith altered the name of the
  species from Hylæus to Prini. It is of a pale green colour, with six lateral oblique pink lines,
  the last of which extends to the base of the nearly straight tail, which is of the same colour;
  the chrysalis is chesnut, without any porrected tongue-case. One of these caterpillars, observed
  by Abbot, went into the ground on the 17th of May, and appeared as a moth on the 19th of June;
  whilst another buried itself on the 25th of August, and remained in the earth until the 26th of
  April. The caterpillar is subject to the attacks of a small Ichneumon, the larvæ of which, when
  full grown, eat their way out of its body and spin themselves up on the outside. The moth is
  occasionally seen sucking the blossoms of gourds in the twilight, but is not common.</p>

  attention, says, "Inveni hanc speciem in Sierra Leona mensibus Aprilis et præcipue Majo copiose in

  <p class="sp3">The insect figured by Drury is stated to have been received from Norway. No
  Longicorn beetle, corresponding with Drury's insect has been ascertained to be a native of that
  country, or indeed of Europe. Hence, as this figure very nearly corresponds with the American
  Lamia dentator of Fabricius, I am inclined to believe that Drury's specimen had been imported from
  North America, in the same manner as the specimen described and figured by Mr. Haworth in the
  Transactions of the former Entomological Society, and which was taken near London. I have,
  however, marked the synonyms with doubt, this figure having been overlooked by all subsequent
  authors.</p>

  family Elateridæ are all, as Drury observes, provided with an instrument which extends along the
  breast, about the thickness of the thighs, to the abdomen, where the end of it is received into a
  groove, forming a spring, by which the creature, when laid on its back, can jump to a considerable
  height, from which circumstance it has received the name of Elater.</p>

  <p>The family Blattidæ, corresponding with the Linnæan genus Blatta, may be regarded as containing
  one of the most obnoxious assemblages of our insect enemies. Of this family, this and the two
  following figures represent different species. The observations upon the economy of this family,
  published by our author in the preface to this work, present the most complete account of the
  ravages and obnoxious qualities of this tribe which has hitherto been published. They are as
  follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">"The <i>cock-roaches</i> are another race of pestiferous beings, equally noisome
  and mischievous to natives or strangers, but particularly to collectors. These nasty and voracious
  insects fly out in the evenings, and commit monstrous depredations; they plunder and erode all
  kinds of victuals, drest and undrest, and damage all sorts of clothing, especially those which are
  touched with powder, pomatum, and similar substances; every thing made of leather, books, paper,
  and various other articles, which, if they do not destroy, at least they soil, as they frequently
  deposit a drop of their excrement where they settle, and some way or other, by that means damage
  what they cannot devour. They fly into the flame of candles, and sometimes into the dishes; are
  very fond of ink and of oil, into which they are apt to fall and perish. In this case they soon
  turn most offensively putrid, so that a man might as well sit over the cadaverous body of a large
  animal, as write with the ink in which they have died. They often fly into persons' faces or
  bosoms, and their legs being armed with sharp spines, the pricking excites a sudden horror not
  easily described. In old houses they swarm by myriads, making every part filthy beyond description
  wherever they harbour, which in the day time is in dark corners, behind all sorts of clothes, in
  trunks, boxes, and, in short, every place where they can lie concealed. In old timber and deal
  houses, when the family is retired at night to sleep, this insect, among other disagreeable
  properties, has the power of making a noise which very much resembles a pretty smart knocking with
  the knuckle upon the wainscotting. The Blatta Gigantea of Linnæus in the West Indies are therefore
  frequently known by the name of Drummers. Three or four of these noisy creatures will sometimes be
  impelled to answer one another, and cause <span class="pagenum" id="page71">{71}</span>such a
  drumming noise, that none but those who are very good sleepers can rest for them. What is most
  disagreeable, those who have not gauze curtains are sometimes attacked by them in their sleep. The
  sick and dying have their extremities attacked, and the ends of the toes and fingers of the dead
  are frequently stripped of both skin and flesh."</p>

  frequent in houses in the West Indies, and is called the Drummer, from the noise it makes by
  beating against the wainscot.</p>

  <p>This large and remarkable species of winged bug is commonly known in the West Indies under the
  name of the Wheel-bug, and is stated by Messrs. Kirby and Spence to possess the power of
  communicating an electric shock to the person whose flesh it touches. "The late Major-General
  Davies, of the Royal Artillery, once informed me, that when abroad, having taken up this animal
  and placed it upon his hand, it gave him a considerable shock, as if from an electric jar, with
  its legs, which he felt as high as his shoulders; and dropping the creature, he observed six marks
  upon his hand where the six feet had stood." (Intr. to Ent. 1. 110.)</p>

  <p>There appear to be several species confounded under the specific name of serratus. The one
  figured by our author is well distinguished by the colour of its rostrum and tibiæ, which are
  fulvous or orange-coloured. (Fabricius calls them yellow "flavis," and Burmeister red "rufis.") I
  have received this species from Valparaiso. Another species having brown tibiæ, of a narrower
  form, rather smaller than the preceding, and having fewer teeth upon the scutellar crest, is very
  abundant in Pennsylvania. It may be distinguished by the following character<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">The sting of these insects produced by the short and powerful proboscis is
  accompanied with very considerable pain. Mr. Smeathman informed Mr. Drury that he had been stung
  by the largest wasps of Africa, as well as by these bugs, and thought the pain inflicted by the
  latter much more severe, though the effect does not remain so long. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page74">{74}</span>pain is doubtless caused by that pungent volatile fluid which affects our
  smell so much when we catch those insects, with which they are abundantly supplied, and which they
  emit with considerable force.</p>

  <p>The larger species of this family are often mistaken for locusts and grasshoppers, in
  consequence of the loud chirping noise which they make, and which is sometimes so strong that Mr.
  Smeathman had no doubt that it might be heard a mile. They are occasionally, he continues, very
  numerous in the woods, where they make the hills and vallies ring, continuing their noise for
  hours together; at other times, when they are more scarce, bursting forth only at intervals. This
  chirp or whistle is in general harsh and dissonant, though sometimes, like Thomson's Stock Dove,
  their note,</p>

  <div class="poem poemc20">
    <p style="margin-left:-0.40em">"Discordant heard alone, aids the full concert."</p>

  <p class="sp3">Amongst the planters and English settlers of the West Indies they are however
  called the razor-grinders, their noise being by these persons likened to that made in grinding
  knives and razors. Kalm evidently alludes to these insects in his Tour of North America, where he
  says in some places they make so much noise, that unless two persons meeting together can speak
  louder than the insect can chirp, they cannot hear each other.</p>

  whence it belongs to the genus Myrmica.</p>

  <p>The reader will find some interesting general details relative to the habits of the exotic
  species of the family to which this insect belongs, in the following observations which were
  published in the preface to the third volume, in the former edition of this work.</p>

  <p>"The various species of <i>ants, cock-roaches, and other voracious vermin</i>, are so numerous
  as to be one of the greatest plagues the collector abroad has to encounter, insomuch that it is
  barely possible to preserve dried insects, and other animals, with the utmost care and the closest
  boxes, much less living ones, which require light and air: for as soon as caterpillars are brought
  out of the woods, and placed within doors, with an intention of breeding them, they seem to be, as
  in fact they are, out of the order of nature, and quickly fall victims to the rapacity of those
  agents whose province it is to remove animal or vegetable bodies, which having arisen to maturity,
  or lost the principles of life, are on their progress toward a slow dissolution, a state of
  useless inanimation or noxious putrescence. Indeed among these none are more useful in this point
  of view than the <i>ants</i>; but, considered as <i>noxious vermin</i>, and capable of destroying
  animals, or, in many instances, of preventing and frustrating human industry, we know perhaps of
  none more formidable. These insects, whether considered as the efficient servants of nature,
  keeping clean and wholesome the face of the creation, or as the ministers of Almighty Power
  preserving a due equality between animals and vegetables, perform, without exemption or reserve,
  his high behests. Like the angel of heaven, they walk steadily forward in the line ordained them,
  and spare neither magnitude nor beauty, neither the living nor the dead, but sweep away all kinds
  of animal substances with undeviating rigour and rapacious perseverance.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes they proceed, like those I have mentioned in the preface to my first volume, driving
  all the inhabitants out of a town in a few hours, to a scene of which Mr. Smeathman was an
  eye-witness; and in other instances, as within the last twenty years, in some of the Caribbee
  Islands, like a slow but irresistible fire, they gradually, in two or three years, take possession
  of the land, and carry death and destruction to every kind of animals; so that not only pigeons
  and fowls, lambs and kids, but even calves and foals, which have been brought forth in the night,
  have been destroyed before the rising of the sun; and the inhabitants themselves, though they
  placed the posts of their beds in troughs of water, were driven out of them by these inevitable
  disturbers. This slow but enormous increase of ants in some of the sugar islands was unknown
  before the conclusion of the last peace; since which time they seem, in conjunction with some
  other insects, to have taken possession of many valuable sugar estates, and, by sucking the canes,
  have rendered <span class="pagenum" id="page80">{80}</span>them incapable of yielding any of that
  rich juice from whence this vegetable salt is extracted.</p>

  <p>"In consequence of this mischievous quality, estates which, by their usual produce, have
  cleared to the proprietors eight or ten thousand pounds a year, when overrun by these vermin, have
  not been able to pay the expense of cultivation, except the produce has been changed by planting
  cotton or indigo, which have been found to suffer much less from their depredations; but,
  unhappily, most of the planters were ruined before they could submit to give up the cultivation of
  sugar, which is by much the most profitable.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"It is not to be supposed, that hot countries are at all times infested to this
  degree. They never are, however, without an astonishing number of these insects, which no art,
  labour, or expense, can totally exclude from the dwellings of the inhabitants. The number of
  different species is not yet known, and is so great, added to the minuteness of most of them, that
  it probably never will be discovered with any degree of certainty. There are not less than fifteen
  or twenty species, which find their way into the houses. These are not only to be distinguished by
  their size, figure, and colour, but by their different properties. Some are near an inch long,
  from which, to that of being scarce visible to the naked eye, are various sizes. Some are long and
  slender, others short and thick; some are elegantly shaped and highly polished; while others are,
  according to vulgar apprehensions, deformed, armed with spines, and covered with bristly or coarse
  and rough skins. Some species also are black as the deepest jet; others of the deepest brown, or
  of different shades till they approach to yellow; and not a few are variegated, having some of the
  prismatic colours in full glow. They vary as much in their nature and dispositions: some destroy
  fresh collected plants; and, in spite of weights laid upon the books in which they are placed to
  dry, get in, cut the leaves and flowers in pieces, and carry them away. Others, of different
  species, attack all sorts of victuals, particularly sweet things, such as sugar and fruits. Mr.
  Smeathman has had large sugar-dishes emptied by these insects in one night, when the least opening
  has been left; and it is not easy to make any tin canister, or other vessel, close enough to
  exclude these insidious plunderers; so that the loss sustained in this article is often very
  great. Some of them will assail the side-boards, and cover every wine-glass that has had wine or
  punch left in it; nay, innumerable multitudes will even attack the liquors on your table, and, if
  you are not attentive, drown themselves in the very bowls and bottles before you. Some stragglers
  frequently disturb you by creeping over your skin, and interrupt your sleep or your meditations by
  biting, which, however, give pain but for a moment; while others, though of the smallest size,
  with a sort of malignant vengeance, creep under your clothes, and, by means of stings invisible to
  the unassisted eye, inject a most acrid venom, which causes a pain as sharp as a small spark of
  fire, lasting for some hours, and even a day or two after being stung, the pain of which is much
  increased by irritating the part. Some of the larger sorts also cause by their stings a pain
  which, for some moments, is scarcely less than that of a bee of the same size; but it <span
  class="pagenum" id="page81">{81}</span>ceases in a few minutes, without leaving any inflammation
  behind. The different manners of this large and sagacious tribe of insects are, according to my
  friend's account, exceedingly various and amusing, but much too long for this occasion; neither
  would it be proper for me to enter farther into an account of them, as that gentleman purposes to
  treat minutely on their various histories in his Voyages and Travels: a book which, he informs me,
  is in some forwardness, and will doubtless afford great entertainment and information to the
  curious part of mankind."</p>

  endeavours to force the point of the abdomen through the skin of the hand, but its strength is not
  adequate to the task. The whole abdomen resembles a much elongated pedicle, from which the abdomen
  itself, or dilated portion, has been accidentally removed.</p>

  <p class="sp3">From the information furnished to Mr. Drury by Mr. Smeathman we learn that the
  children in Africa are, at the proper season, very busily employed digging out of the ground the
  females, when full of eggs, of a species exactly the size and form of this, on which they make an
  agreeable repast, roasting generally the whole animal, but eating only the eggs, which are
  contained in a bag, and resemble part of the roe of a large fish, deeming it very delicate food.
  These, like the European crickets, make a continual and noisy chirping all day long; and the open
  parts of the country are never without this music, which ceases neither night nor day. Some sing
  only in the day, others only in the night, and others again are never silent. Of those which sing
  only in the night, one small species, about the size of the Gryllus Campestris of Linnæus, sallies
  out of its retreat early in the evening, making so loud and shrill a chirping that it may he said
  to pierce the ear; and, as certainly as it sings within doors, it silences a whole company. It
  fills a large room so completely with its note, which is something like the sound caused by
  rubbing a tobacco-pipe round the edge of a wine-glass, that those unaccustomed to it cannot tell
  how to direct their search after it. When they are looking for it, the noise will sometimes cease
  for half a minute, and begin again, when the searchers will be as much at a loss as ever. The
  black people, however, who have perhaps the most accurate ears in the world, readily find them,
  and generally without mercy put an end to their lives and their notes together. Different species
  sing their wild notes among the distant banks, and are heard in the rivers through the mangroves,
  though those trees often form a thick wood between the navigable <span class="pagenum"
  id="page92">{92}</span>parts of the river and the dry land of a quarter or half a mile deep. The
  mountains and the woods also echo with them all the night long, and the full concert is very
  distinctly heard on board the ships, during a calm night, as they lie at their usual anchorages in
  the bays and creeks on the sea coasts.</p>

  <p class="sp3">According to Mr. Smeathman these bees are very injurious to wooden houses, the
  posts of which they bore and perforate in various directions, so as to weaken them very much. The
  holes they make are half an inch in diameter. Drury hazards the conjecture, that the curiously
  dilated anterior tarsi, and the long hairs with which it is furnished, appear to be useful to the
  creature for containing the substance of which these insects compose their nests. This, however,
  is but mere conjecture; since it is the males only which possess this curious construction; and
  this sex takes no share in the construction or provisioning of the nest in any species of bees
  with whose economy we are hitherto acquainted. There are certainly several distinct species
  confounded together under the common name of Xylocopa latipes.</p>

    number of articulations (not less than fifty) being thickest at their roots, from whence they
    diminish a little to their extremities. Head oblong, with two short thick spines on the top,
    near the front. Eyes small, round, black, and distant. Four palpi, each 4-jointed; that next the
    mouth being the shortest. Mouth appearing not to be furnished with strong teeth or jaws, but
    seeming rather formed for macerating tender plants. Neck and thorax having a great many short
    thick spines on them; particularly the latter, which has a ridge on each side, full of spines
    like the teeth of a saw, extending to the abdomen. "It is evident this species is furnished with
    wings when arrived to its complete state, by the rudiments observable in this; which, though
    they are exceeding small, are a sufficient proof it is not wingless." Abdomen composed of seven
    articulations; the last being divided into three smaller ones, from whence springs from the
    under part an instrument that extends about half an inch beyond the tail, being shaped like a
    three-edged sword; each side being hollowed and grooved like that weapon. When first received,
    the abdomen was considerably broader than it is now, being then nearly the breadth of a man's
    thumb; but now is contracted one-fourth, and in proportion every other part is less, except the
    head. The hind legs are longer than the rest; but are not formed, like the locust tribe, for
    leaping. The under part of the thighs are furnished with short thick spines; those on the hinder
    ones being the strongest, and most conspicuous. The tips of the femora are furnished with two
    thick strong spines, which are placed on each side the joint. The tibiæ are short and thick. The
    tarsi consist of five articulations besides the claws; the bottom of each having a valve or
    sucker to it; those placed between the hooks being considerably larger than the others, by which
    the creature is enabled to climb up any thing perpendicularly that has a smooth surface.</p>
